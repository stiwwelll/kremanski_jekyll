Next Saturday proudly present: Nick Evans – a singer/songwriter and environmental policy student from a mountaintop town in Tennessee. Having spent the larger part of his life in small town America, Nick made the leap in 2014 not only to the city (as many do) but across the ocean, eventually settling in Berlin, Germany. His songs blend folk and Americana styles with introspective and natural lyrics.
<br>
<br>Evans’ debut solo EP, “American Drab,” was released in Winter 2016.
