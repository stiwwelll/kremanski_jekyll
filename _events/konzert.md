**Elsye Suquilanda – Ligia Liberatori – Minsk (Mijal Bloch)**
<br>…three women of the latin-american galaxy went out from different points of their world to explore the cosmos and to find their own voices in the industrialized systems.
<br>Hazard, chances and love took them all to the planet 030-Berlin. In this place they put music to their thoughts, experiments and biographical sublimations.
<br>A Spacefrau
<br>ist a Spacefrau
<br>ist a Spacefrau
<br>is a multilingual woman,
<br>is a space-time game,
<br>is a body language and beyond.
<br>Electronic space sounds, gaucho-voltaic female guitars and in-corporeal voice frequencies gather together to tell about the intrepid and exasperating experience from outer space migration.
